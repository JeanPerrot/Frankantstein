This is the source code for my entry to the ants ai challenge (http://aichallenge.org/)

Items of note:
- curiousattemptbunny and myself gave a shot at merging our bots logic. This never got anywhere, but his code is in here.
- this is not pretty code... Really quite ugly.

For the record, this bot finished 161st out of 8k.
