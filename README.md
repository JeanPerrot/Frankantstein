This is the source code for my entry to the ants ai challenge (http://aichallenge.org/)

Items of note:
<br/>- curiousattemptbunny and myself gave a shot at merging our bots logic. This never got anywhere, but his code is in here.
<br/>- this is not pretty code... Really quite ugly.

For the record, this bot finished 156th out of 8k. (http://aichallenge.org/profile.php?user=6950)
